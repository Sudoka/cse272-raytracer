\section*{Introduction}
In this assignment we explore different methods of estimating the irradiance over a line in a scene. The scene used for the assignment has a rectangular diffuse area light with corners $(-1.75,-1,-0.05)$ and $(1.75,-1,0.05)$ (area $A=0.35\ m^2$) and normal $\mathbf{n_l}=(0,1,0)$ and power $\phi=100\ W$. Above the area light there is a diffuse square with corners $(-1,0,-1)$ and $(1,0,1)$ with normal $\mathbf{n_s}=(0,1,0)$. Above the square there is a mirror with corners $(-2,1,-2)$ and $(2,1,2)$ and normal $(0,-1,0)$. We estimated the irradiance over a line $AB$ between the points $A=(-1,0,0)$ and $B=(1,0,0)$ using Monte Carlo path tracing, progressive photon mapping, adaptive(Metropolis) photon mapping and Metropolis path tracing.
